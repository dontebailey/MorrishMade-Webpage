*MORRISHMADE PROJECT*

This was a project idea I had for one of my friends who is a custom knife maker. I wanted to make an entry level webpage for his business.

*THE ISSUES*
(I will be working in my spare time to fix these problems)

A) The login and signup pages need work they have problems processing the request

B) The overall page needs to adjust to different viewport dimensions

*OVERALL*

Besides the issues I still need to fix it was a great learning experience and I had alot of fun on this project and it was a project idea I had planned for a while. It was awesome being able to have an idea become a reality. I would eventually like to recreate this webpage with a more modern interface as I increase my skills. I would also like it to be fully functioning for my friend to use for his business.
